    Deep Convolutional Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) by PyTorch is here. The dataset is
    the Street View House Numbers Dataset (SVHN). Python notebook and its PDF are in the
    directory.

    NLP, "Becoming Jane by Deep Learning" is here. This is my old attempt to generate
    Jane Austen-like sentences by training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
