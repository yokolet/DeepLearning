DeepLearning Samples

- [dcgan](https://github.com/yokolet/DeepLearning/blob/master/dcgan)

    Deep Convolutional Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) by PyTorch is here. The dataset is
    the Street View House Numbers Dataset (SVHN). Python notebook and its PDF are in the
    directory.

- [Jane](https://github.com/yokolet/DeepLearning/blob/master/Jane)

    NLP, "Becoming Jane by Deep Learning" is here. This is my old attempt to generate
    Jane Austen-like sentences by training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

- [cnn](https://github.com/yokolet/DeepLearning/blob/master/cnn)

    Image clasification by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project. This is one of
    Udacity Deep Learning project. Using Resnet50 for a transfer learning, Dog breeds were
    detected by CNN.

- [rnn](https://github.com/yokolet/DeepLearning/blob/master/rnn)

    NLP by Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) project. This is also one of Udacity Deep
    Learning project. Dataset is Simpsons' TV script. RNN model was trained using TV
    script, then, TV script was generated.
