DeepLearning Samples

- [dcgan](https://github.com/yokolet/DeepLearning/blob/master/dcgan)

    Deep Convolutional Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) by PyTorch is here. The dataset is
    the Street View House Numbers Dataset (SVHN). Python notebook and its PDF are in the
    directory.

- [Jane](https://github.com/yokolet/DeepLearning/blob/master/Jane)

    NLP, "Becoming Jane by Deep Learning" is here. This is my old attempt to generate
    Jane Austen-like sentences by training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

- [cnn](https://github.com/yokolet/DeepLearning/blob/master/cnn)

    Image clasification by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project. This is one of
    Udacity Deep Learning project. Using Resnet50 for a transfer learning, Dog breeds were
    detected by CNN.
